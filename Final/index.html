<h2>Welcome to my page. I, Shannel Doshi, am a community service and a visual designer and this my little home of illustrations. These designs define my dreams, my moods and more importantly me during the time I fought depression.</h2>

    <p> I often think about the way I am looked at, and in many ways how I look at others. It makes me think whether how I feel is in my head or the way I am made to feel. She stares, stares and stares infinetly, unconditionaly and uncontrollably.  </p>

    <p> I am pulled but I am resistant not because I have to be, but because it is a choice they make for me.  </p>

    <p> And when time is ticking I often wonder how I spend my energy on a screem. I suppose it is a part of my lifestyle. The question is am I obligated? Am I isolated? Or am I entertained? One truly knows when they de-romanticise their inner needs. </p>

    <p> Flying or diving? Guess you will only know till you reach your end. But what they do assure you is that you will be geared and well in control of yourself and your actions. Yes, you may slip but your roots are strong and so I ask them to hold on tight.</p>

    <p> You can see things coming at you. What is worse if it is coming for you. If you know me well, you will know that I will panic. But what is composure and patience when everything rushes over your understanding.</div></div> <br>  <br> <br>

    <p> I googled the definition of freedom when I knew for myself that it was just one word: BRAVERY. </p>

    <p> They told me I was on a loop. Or was I spiraling? It is true though because when I rest, I observe, and then I get back on my feet because the good old anxiety won't let me rest. I want to be in multiple places and it is exciting to know that I am somewhat there, probably just a step away.</p>

    <p> I see light and I see darkness but they say I am mostly in the middle, not exposed to either. This one's way of finding a direction, their own journey into what may evolve into their freedom and light.  </p>
