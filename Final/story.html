<p>Really glad to know you on FB. To give u some context, I am having the best time of my life perusing an abroad education in one of the world s most beautiful city. By nature, I dont mingle so much with people, speak less, dont really have friends to flock around with , in this beautiful pardes. But I am know how to enjoy my own company too. 
My concern : I am actually trying to overcome a long long ago disapproval by someone whom I really liked. He used to like me while we were studying, but not any more now. He likes someone else now.But thats ok. What hurts me is that he didnt even value the old beautiful friendship both of us shared wen we were studying :( I think and feel bad about him everyday, everytime. He doesnt even reply properly to my messages. :( So just keeping in touch with him is also not an option for me. Somehow I never get the urge to open up and speak to others around me. My friends of my age are happily getting married to their boyfriends. Feel left out.</p> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
