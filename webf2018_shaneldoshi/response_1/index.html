    <h1> Question Response to Scroll, Skim, Stare | The White Review</h1>
    
<ul>
    <li> Does having an image of an installation artist on his/her website justify the essence of their work? </li>
    <li> "Art means engaging with images", although for contemporary artists of today, how do they find avenues to express and create distinction (apart from websites) if not upload images of their works? </li>
